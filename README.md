# Liri-Node-App
    LIRI Will be able to search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

## Will be using 
* Node.js to provide library resources and async functionality with multiple API's.
* Inquirer.js library to create command line interface. Link to library: [Inquirer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
* Node-Spotify-API 
* Moment
* DotEnv

## How it works?
